# Searching-2

Task 1:
A linear search checks each element in the array one by one so it would four steps to find 8 in the array [2,4,6,8,10,12,13].

Task 2: 
A binary search has a different method compared to a linear search in that it repeatidly divides the search interval in half
when it comes to a sorted array. It would find 8 in one step in the array [2,4,6,8,10,12,13].

Task 3: 
The maximum number of steps it would take to do a binary search in array the size of n would be given by the formula log(n) 
with a base of two. In the question the value of n is 1000,000. So putting 100,000 in the equation would be log(100,000)
with base 2 would give us the maxium amount of steps it would take. The following eqaution gives us a value of 16.61 steps
